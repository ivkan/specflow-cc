### Task Groups

| Group | Wave | Tasks | Dependencies | Est. Context | Cumulative |
|-------|------|-------|--------------|--------------|------------|
| G1 | 1 | Create types.ts interfaces | — | ~15% | 15% |
| G2 | 2 | Create partition-handler.ts | G1 | ~20% | 35% |
| G3 | 2 | Create topic-handler.ts | G1 | ~20% | 55% |
| G4 | 3 | Wire handlers in ServerCoordinator | G2, G3 | ~25% | 80% |

**Context thresholds:**
- Per-group target: ≤30% (split if exceeded)
- Cumulative warning: >60% (use orchestrated mode)
- Cumulative blocker: >80% (must split spec)

### Execution Plan

| Wave | Groups | Parallel? | Workers |
|------|--------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | G1 | No | 1 |
| 2 | G2, G3 | Yes | 2 |
| 3 | G4 | No | 1 |
